# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
The Purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program for Pewlett-Hackard Company. This report will hopefully prepare the company for the "Silver Tsunami" that will soon effect the company as many employees approach the age of retirement.
